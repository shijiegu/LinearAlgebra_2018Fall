# LinearAlgebra_2018Fall
Welcome to the LinearAlgebra_2018Fall repo.

Here are the section notes by me and additional resources by the instructors (Prof. Matthew Randall and Prof. Chengjian Yao) for the linear algebra course at ShanghaiTech University. The course follows the famous book: Intro to Linear Algebra by Strang. 

How to use the materials:
Prior to eigenvector (section7), notes are written with the expectation that you read the book either before or with the handouts. Starting from section7, the book started to decline in quality and clarity. I wrote the section notes with the expectation that you do not read the textbook. I would like to acknowledge Prof. Michale Fee at MIT and Dr. Emily Mackevicius at Columbia University for sharing some of the materials. There are also some good resources I found on the Internet that I included: please let me know if you think I should remove them if it violates your copyright.

This is my first time TA'ing this course. Suggestions on the materials will be appreciated: techel@live.cn or gushj@shanghaitech.edu.cn
